This function should return a vector of vector of strings with each possible RNA
reading frame from the given DNA sequence.

There are three possible reading frames (because the genetic code has three
nucleotides per amino acid) in each direction (you can also transcribe DNA in
the reverse complement direction, called the antiparallel strand).

Order the sequences like so:
1: Original (0 offset)
2: Original (1 offset)
3: Original (2 offset)
4: Antiparallel (0 offset)
5: Antiparallel (1 offset)
6: Antiparallel (2 offset)

Antiparallel RNA transcript = AAUUCCCGAAA

UUGCCCAAUU
UGCCCAAUU
